# tyclauss_portfolio_site
This is a Portfolio site that I built as part of Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree

Currently it shows images of projects I have worked on or will work on in the very near future.

Eventually the project section will link directly to this GitHub profile so project code can be viewed.

I have lots of ideas for how to improve it and can't wait to see how it evolves over my career!
